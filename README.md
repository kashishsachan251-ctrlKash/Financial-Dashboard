🚀 **Financial Dashboard in Power Bi — Key Insights & Summary**

I built an interactive **Financial Performance Dashboard** to analyze sales, profitability, discounts, and product performance across multiple countries and segments.
Below are the most important business insights derived from the analysis:

📊 **Revenue & Profitability**
• Total Gross Sales: **127.93M**
• Total Profit: **16.89M**
• Total Income: **118.73M**
• Total COGS: **101.83M**
• Total Discounts: **9.21M**
• Units Sold: **1.13M**

The company is profitable with a healthy margin, but discounts significantly impact final income.

🌍 **Geographical Performance**
• **United States** generates the highest contribution to total sales
• Other countries (Canada, France, Germany, Mexico) show balanced distribution (~17–21%)
➡️ Revenue is diversified but still dependent on the US market

🧩 **Customer Segments**
• Government segment contributes the highest sales (~44%)
• Small Business follows (~36%)
• Enterprise contributes moderate share (~16%)
• Midmarket & Channel Partners are minor contributors

➡️ Public sector customers are the primary revenue driver

📦 **Product Performance**
Top selling products:

1. Paseo — 36M
2. VTT — 22M
3. Velo — 20M
4. Amarilla — 19M

Lowest performers:
• Montana & Carretera

➡️ Sales are concentrated in 3–4 flagship products

🏭 **Manufacturing Cost Impact**
• Highest manufacturing cost: VTT (27K) & Amarilla (24K)
• Lowest: Montana & Carretera

➡️ High-cost products are not always the top revenue generators — opportunity for cost optimization

💸 **Discount Analysis**
• High & Medium discount bands drive most sales (~84M combined)
• Low discount and No discount contribute significantly less

➡️ Sales strategy relies heavily on discounting to increase volume

📅 **Time Trends**
• Best Year: **2014 (99M)**
• Lowest Year: **2013 (29M)**
• Highest Month: **October (23M)**
• Lowest Month: **March**

➡️ Strong yearly growth but seasonal monthly fluctuations

🧠 **Business Takeaways**
✔ Focus on Government & Small Business customers
✔ Optimize discount strategy to protect margins
✔ Improve low-performing products or discontinue
✔ Reduce manufacturing cost on high-cost items
✔ Prepare inventory & marketing campaigns before Q4 peak season
